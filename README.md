## Why I created log(HW):

Ever since entering high school, my physical homework log has been seeing less and less use. Sometimes, like after a long lecture or class activity, there simply isn’t enough time to jot down the homework before dashing to the next class. Other times, though not very student-ly of me, it can be attributed to laziness or forgetfulness. Thus, I came to rely on having my friends tell me through WeChat and the school website. While they are both fine applications in their own rights, they lack the compact presentation of a traditional homework log in which a student can quickly discern the homework for the day for each course with a single glance. log(HW) combines the best of both worlds—it retains the compact format of a traditional homework log, and it is also digitized to facilitate the sharing of homework.

## How it works:

After registration, students can personalize their homework logs by selecting the courses that they’re taking (they are also allowed to change them later too). When they return to the home page, they will see the homework log with the courses they chose. To edit the homework of a course, proceed to the Course Details page by clicking the orange edit button underneath the course’s name. In the Course Details page, students could edit the homework or look at the five previous homework assignments. All edits to the homework of a course will appear on the homework log of any other student that selected the same course.

## Purpose:

log(HW) is an online homework log made exclusively for SMIC students. Currently, it is only available for high school. For diligent students who already have no problems tracking homework, this website makes it more convenient to help other students. For those that are less organized, this website shows them what exactly needs to be completed for homework, helping them better schedule and manage their time. My vision for this website is that at the end of the school day, students could pull out their phones, open a web browser, type in the website address, and look through their homework logs—a process that should take no more than 10 seconds. Thanks to the server being hosted in Shanghai and the website itself being lightweight, log(HW) loads extremely fast (if you're in Shanghai).

## Will this make posting homework on the school website obsolete?

No. Space for writing homework on log(HW) is limited, much like a traditional homework log. Its purpose is not to list out all the specifics of each assignment, but to provide a general overview on the homework for the day. Detailed instructions will still go on the school website.
